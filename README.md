# Hello-World-
Hey all, I'm @Javie22. I'm interested in developing, programming and algorithm. I'm currently learning, source codes, languages, (Java script, python, lil bit of some others) Programming different types/ways and developing, so I can develop my own stuff in the future. Definitely, want to build/develop my own Raspberry PI. I'm gonna be learning algorithm next, I want to collaborate with an algorithm genius one day, (hopefully I'll get good enough). I'm open to learn from new ideas and suggestions, as I am new to all this. You can reach me at jayvierose48@gmail.com
